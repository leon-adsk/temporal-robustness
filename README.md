# Testing Temporal Robustness in Malware Image Detection
[TODO: add abstract here]
We provide this repository to allow for easy reproduction of our results.

## Instructions
This repository contains two major parts:
1. Models and Experiments: The code needed to train and validate both our model as well as the reproduction of Pant and Bista's model. This is split into four distinct experiments: `reproduction`, `temporal baseline`, `forward`, `backward`.
2. Visualization: The Jupyter Notebooks used to generate the graphs seen in the paper.

To begin the reproduction process make sure *uv* is installed and run `uv run main.py`. All dependencies will be installed for you, except for the datasets. You will be guided through dataset installation and image generation and asked to choose which experiments you would like to reproduce.
